# Advanced Financial Analysis and Trading Strategy

This repository contains Python code for an advanced financial analysis and trading strategy that uses machine learning to identify optimal stock portfolios based on historical performance and various technical indicators.

## Overview

The project utilizes Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `pandas_datareader`, `yfinance`, and machine learning with `sklearn` to perform data retrieval, processing, financial analysis, and visualization. The strategy involves calculating technical indicators, selecting stocks based on volume trading criteria, and applying machine learning algorithms to identify stock clusters and optimize portfolio weights.

## Features

- Retrieval of stock data for multiple tickers via `yfinance`.
- Calculation of various technical indicators like RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and Garman-Klass volatility.
- Monthly resampling of data to capture end-of-month values.
- Use of clustering to identify patterns in stock data.
- Portfolio optimization using Efficient Frontier to determine optimal stock weights.
- Visualization of stock clusters and portfolio performance over time.
